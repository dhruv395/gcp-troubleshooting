If you enable firewall in ubuntu machine and don't allow port 22, you won't be able to ssh that machine later.

To be able to ssh the machine, follow these steps:
- stop the machine
- click on the edit 
- go to, Custom metadata
-  click add item
-     add key,              value pair as,
    startup-script        #! /bin/bash
                          ufw allow 22
                     
- save and start the instance.
- you should be able to ssh now.
